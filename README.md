Credits
=========
This project uses a class named "MemoryAPI" which was developed by someone smarter than me in order to read and write to process memory. Unfortunately I do not know your name and cannot find a link to the code. Credits are reserved for whoever that was.

This project has a reference to the MemorySharp library from the developers at http://binarysharp.com. Current code does not use the library however.

All other code is by me. Memory offsets were discovered using CheatEngine.
